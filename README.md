# SemanticCuetSync-DravidianLangTech-2025

The rise of social media has significantly facil-
itated the rapid spread of hate speech. Detect-
ing hate speech for content moderation is chal-
lenging, especially in low-resource languages
(LRLs) like Telugu. Although some progress
has been noticed in hate speech detection in
Telegu concerning unimodal (text or image)
in recent years, there is a lack of research on
hate speech detection based on multimodal
content detection (specifically using audio and
text). In this regard, DravidianLangTech has
arranged a shared task to address this chal-
lenge. This work explores three machine learn-
ing (ML), three deep learning (DL), and seven
transformer-based models that integrate text
and audio modalities using cross-modal atten-
tion for hate speech detection. The evaluation
results demonstrate that mBERT achieved the
highest F-1 score of 49.68% using text. How-
ever, the proposed multimodal attention-based
approach with Whisper-small+TeluguBERT-3
achieves an F-1 score of 43 68%, which helps
us achieve a rank of 3rd in the shared task com-
petition.
